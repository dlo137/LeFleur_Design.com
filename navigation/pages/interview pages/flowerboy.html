              I’m going to say the cockiness of where this flower blooms... It
              was like... Do you feel like you were accepting yourself?
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              Well, sometimes I’m just like. It’s a lot of things that- and I
              don’t want to take credit but there’s a lot of things that I was
              doing... and people were like “what was he doing?” and two years
              later it’s what everyones doing.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="Z">
              <b id="Z">Jared</b>
              mhm.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              Whether it’s the way the videos are doing or these stupid pop shop
              things or whatever... and im not taking credit but it’s like I was
              doing that and no ones ever puts me on any of these lists or even
              respects me in the sense that I want it... So i was just- and
              that’s why that line is like... “ aint nobody fucking with T, but
              that may just be my ego, but dont be too cool, because I may
              freeze.” and I’m stuck in this egotistical mindstate and I never
              move foward. and that’s how niggas freeze to death but...
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="Z">
              <b id="Z">Jared</b>
              But then you carry that into- the ice-
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              But that ice shit ways a ton. My ice cause it was cold. Water your
              garden my nigga and then stunt. I got a flower chain made... like
              with all these different things and that’s what I was talking
              about, but I also was like you know what? fuck these niggas. Keep
              doing my shit. Uh, tell these black kids they can do whatever they
              want.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="Z">
              <b id="Z">Jared</b>
              That’s one of my favorite uhhh lyrics. Is just tell these black
              kids they can be who they are.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              Dude right?!
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="Z">
              <b id="Z">Jared</b>
              Like it’s one of my favorite- You had another uh... um.. god...
              you had another lyric like that on cherry bomb. That was just like
              uh... the world is yours my lil nigga. The world is yours. Like I
              love that, like it’s a similar thing to tell these black kids they
              can be who they are. Were you saying that to you? You saying that
              too?
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              Well I was saying that too me too, but like it’s a uh... a uh...
              It’s, no one saying that to these kids that look like me. To
              anyone that looks like me. We had this conversation just wanting
              this snowboard when I was 12 but someone saying “that’s white
              people shit. Black people don’t do that...
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="Z">
              <b id="Z">Jared</b>
              yea...
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              no... you don’t do that. Don’t put a damper on me and tell me what
              I can and can’t be just because of... the way everyone else was
              thats my same color. And I just feel like.
            </p>
            <br />

          <div class="column2">

            <p id="Z">
              <b id="Z">Jared</b>
              Who you are is such the alternative to what expectations are place
              on young black guy growing up. Like it’s always the- It’s you’re
              influenced by kinda everything. Just kinda like all cultures, so
              do you think you accept that about yourself? Through you’re first
              few albums?
            </p>
            <br />

            <p id="T">
              <b id="T">Tyler</b>
              Oh, I knew who I was at 12.
