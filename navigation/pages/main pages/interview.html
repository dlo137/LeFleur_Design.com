              “favorite” rappers. Ight, they come up, they fire, and what were
              they working for? Cause they want
              <b>the bitches, the money, the cars</b>
              and when they get that. There’s nothing driving them. What drives
              me is getting an idea executed. And everytime I have an idea, it
              shoots for that. It’s not about having the- I don’t give a fuck
              about spotify playlist. I don’t give a fuck about apple playlist.
              I don’t give a fuck about none of that shit. But when something I
              worked hard is on there, and I’m next to the biggest song in the
              world. It’s like “oh wow, these idea made it to that?? Oh shit,
              well hey everyone look...” this is what sitting in my room for
              hours, 7am, every morning, on album six like “ Oh I haven’t- I’m
              not shit yet. Let me perfect this idea, and this melody, and this
              progression and- let me sit on photshop for hours and do this. No,
              the coloring in this video is not right-

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the
              album- I didn’t think people would like

              No no no no. Ther&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;e was a
              small sector of people that liked
              it&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and because I put the
              instrumentals out p&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; eople were
              coming across to it and starting to
              app&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; reciate it. But when that shit
              came out, everyone &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;fucking hated it.
              Everyone did not understand it.
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;"This is fake nerd shit. Actually,
              no. Because &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;your music taste is so fucking
              surface level. You woul&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;dn’t even know
              where this is actually from because th&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;at’s
              the only fucking gauge of anything thats
              ”black&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; & weird” that you can get this
              from. But that’s actu&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ally from this, and
              I’m not saying the albums good o&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;r bad. I’m
              just saying people fucking hated that
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;fucking album.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So when I put this out...and&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; it beat first
              week, and again I don’t make shit to be&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;at
              first week or to beat radio whatever. But for this
              w&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;ork of art... and that album cover, and
              these videos, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;and me doing suit wig thing,

              I think everyone, whether it’s a movie- Quentin Tarantino 
              would probably agree with this. Whether it’s a movie or music, 
              everyone tries to recre- They try to make stuff that gives
               them the feeling that something else had. Not necessarily 
               make the same thing, but the feeling. So, when I was... 
               four, five, six, seven, and I heard Brandy's uhhh
               "always on my mind". Number 10 off that album or number
                8 off faiths album, "soon as I get home". or uh... 
                Sweet taste of love by Janae. and this- those- When I 
                was younger I didn't know what the fuck the chords were but I just said
                "Mom, it goes up and down, it slopes." It's a feeling that that shit gave me.
                And every- The music I like, all have that
            </p>

              and people... I know, I probably sound like a broken record.
              Chords, chords, chords. Tlyer, chords- but that's the shit 
              that I fucking care about more than anything. I listen
              to music all day. So I wanted to make sure this album, every 
              song gave me that feeling of Jesus Fucking Christ. Every time
              I listen to this album I didnt- I couldn't have made this.
            </p>

              Yea, thats why I wonder how you feel when you listen back
              to your music. Because, when I hear you, like the songs you're making.
              I'm like damn, how'd you even know to go from there to there. Because
              some of the most experienced song writers would think that chord progression is Broken!
              Like you shouldn't be able to go from there to there! But it's so instinctive.
